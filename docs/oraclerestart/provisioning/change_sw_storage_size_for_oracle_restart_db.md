# Change the size of Software Storage Location for an existing Oracle Restart Database

In this use case, the Oracle Grid Infrastructure and Oracle Restart Database are initially deployed automatically using Oracle Restart Controller with Custom Storage Class. The responsefile is generated by the Oracle Restart Controller based on input parameters specified in the .yaml file.

In this use case, the Software Home Location for Grid Infrastructure and Database, the ASM Disks are provisioned as Persistent Volumes using custom storage class during the initial deployment. An updated .yaml file is applied to `increase` the size of the Software Home Location.

**NOTE:** The `decrease` in the size of Software Home Location for an existing Oracle Restart Database is `not allowed`.

This example uses `oraclerestart_prov_storage_class_before_sw_home_resize.yaml` to initially provision an Oracle Restart Database using Oracle Restart Controller with:

* 1 Node Oracle Restart
* Headless services for Oracle Restart
  * Oracle Restart node hostname
* Node Port 30007 mapped to port 1521 for Database Listener
* Persistent volumes for ASM Disks created automatically using the Storage Class for Oracle ASM storage
* Persistent volume for Software location is created automatically using the Storage Class. The GI HOME and the RDBMS HOME in the Oracle Restart Pod will be mounted using the corresponding Persistent Volume Claim. Its size is specified by `swLocStorageSizeInGb`.
* Namespace: `orestart`
* Staged Software location on the worker nodes is specified by `hostSwStageLocation`. The Grid Infrastructure and RDBMS Binaries are copied to this location on the worker node.
* Name of Custom Storage Class is specified by `storageClass`.

In this example, 
  * Oracle Restart Database Slim Image `localhost/oracle/database-orestart:19.3.0-slim` is used and it is built using files from [GitHub location](https://github.com/oracle/docker-images/tree/main/OracleDatabase/RAC/OracleRealApplicationClusters#building-oracle-rac-database-container-slim-image). Default image created using files from this project is `localhost/oracle/database-rac:19.3.0-slim`. You need to tag it with name `localhost/oracle/database-orestart:19.3.0-slim`. 
  * When you are building the image yourself, update the image value in the `oraclerestart_prov_storage_class_before_sw_home_resize.yaml` file to point to the container image you have built. 
  * The disks provisioned using custom storage class are mounted inside the Oracle Restart Pod as `/dev/asm-disk1` and `/dev/asm-disk2`. 
  * Specify the size of these devices along with names using the parameter `storageSizeInGb`. Size is by-default in GBs.

**NOTE:** When no separate diskgroup names are specified for CRS Files, Database Files and Recovery Area Files, then the default diskgroup named `+DATA` is created from the disks specified by the parameter `crsAsmDeviceList`.
  
Use the file: [oraclerestart_prov_storage_class_before_sw_home_resize.yaml](./oraclerestart_prov_storage_class_before_sw_home_resize.yaml) for this use case as below:

1. Deploy the `oraclerestart_prov_storage_class_before_sw_home_resize.yaml` file:
    ```sh
    kubectl apply -f oraclerestart_prov_storage_class_before_sw_home_resize.yaml
    oraclerestart.database.oracle.com/oraclerestart-sample created
    ```
2. Check the status of the deployment:
    ```sh
    # Check the status of the Kubernetes Pods:    
    kubectl get all -n orestart

    # Check the logs of a particular pod. For example, to check status of pod "dbmc1-0":    
    kubectl exec -it pod/dbmc1-0 -n orestart -- bash -c "tail -f /tmp/orod/oracle_db_setup.log"
    ===============================
      ORACLE DATABASE IS READY TO USE
    ===============================
    ```
3. Check Details of Kubernetes CRD Object as in this [example](./orestart_storage_class_object_before_sw_home_resize.txt)
4. In order to `increase` the size of Software Home Location, you can use the updated file [oraclerestart_prov_storage_class_after_sw_home_resize.yaml](./oraclerestart_prov_storage_class_after_sw_home_resize.yaml). 
5. Deploy the `oraclerestart_prov_storage_class_after_sw_home_resize.yaml` file:
    ```sh
    $ kubectl apply -f oraclerestart_prov_storage_class_after_sw_home_resize.yaml
    oraclerestart.database.oracle.com/oraclerestart-sample configured
    ```
   You will notice Persistent Volume for the Software Location has been resized. You can check Details of updated Kubernetes CRD Object as in this [example](./orestart_storage_class_object_after_sw_home_resize.txt)
